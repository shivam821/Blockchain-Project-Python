blockchains store data in blocks that are then chained together

For Bitcoin, this blockchain is just a specific type of database that stores every Bitcoin transaction ever made. 

Example of cryptocurrency : ShivamCoin (SC)
transaction example 
t1 : Raj sends Ram 2 SC
t2 : Ram sends Ravi 4.3 SC
t3 : Sam send Dan 3.2 SC
these transaction cam be stored in a block 

block example
b1("AAA",t1,t2,t3) -> 76fd89(hash) hash result of b1
